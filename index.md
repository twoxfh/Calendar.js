## Getting Started

You will need to include the JavaScript file and CSS Style Sheet in the head of your HTML:

```markdown
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/calendarjs.css" />
<script src="src/calendarjs.js"></script>
```

You will also need to set the page character encoding to UTF-8. This can be included in the head of your HTML as follows:

```markdown
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```
<br>

## Creating a container DIV

Add a div into your HTML and assign it an ID, as follows:

```markdown
<div id="calendar"></div>
```
<br>

## Initialising Calendar.Js:

It's now time to initialize Calendar.js, which is done as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  var instance = calendarJs("calendar"); 
</script>
```

After this, the calendar will be rendered and you will have access to the public methods available.
